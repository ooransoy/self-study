**Exercise 1**

(Identities are omitted)

a.

Rotating the real line a half-turn around the fixed point, i.e. $f(x)=2a-x$.

b.

All reflections with an axis passing through the fixed point, and all rotations with the origin at the fixed point.

c.

Rotating the real line a half-turn around the center of the line segment.

d.

The reflection around the line segment, a rotation of a half-turn around the center of the line segment, the reflection around the perpendicular bisector of the line segment.

e.

All rotations around the axis of the line segment, the reflection by the plane that is normal to and bisects the line segment, all reflections by a plane that contains the line segment.
