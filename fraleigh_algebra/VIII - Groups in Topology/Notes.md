# Section 41
Omitting the descriptor "oriented"

A **0-simplex** is a point $P_1$.

A **1-simplex** is an edge $P_1P_2$.
Negating a simplex is negating its orientation. $P_1P_2=-P_2P_1$

A **2-simplex** is a triangle $P_1P_2P_3$.
$P_1P_2P_3=P_2P_3P_1=P_3P_1P_2$
$=-P_1P_3P_2=-P_3P_2P_1=-P_2P_1P_3$
Simply cycling the vertices of a triangle preserves the orientation.

A **3-simplex** is a tetrahedron $P_1P_2P_3P_4$.
Applying any single transposition (or odd permutation) reverses the orientation.
$P_1P_2P_3P_4=-P_1P_2P_4P_3$.

_Applying an even permutation to the vertices preserves orientation, an odd permutation reverses orientation._

**Boundaries**
The boundary of a 0-simplex is the empty simplex. 
$\partial_0(P)=0$.
The boundary of a 1-simplex is the difference of the end and beginning points.
$\partial_1(P_1P_2)=P_2-P_1$.
The boundary of a 2-simplex is the sum of its edges traversed in its orientation.
$\partial_2(P_1P_2P_3)=P_1P_2+P_2P_3+P_3P_1$.
The boundary of a 3-simplex is its faces in clockwise orientation.
$\partial_3(P_1P_2P_3P_4)=P_1P_2P_4+P_2P_3P_4-P_1P_2P_3-P_1P_3P_4$

The **group $C_n(X)$ of n-chains** is the free abelian group generated by the n-simplices of $X$. $\partial_n$ gives a homomorphism from $C_n(X)$ to $C_{n-1}(X)$.

The kernel of $\partial_n : C_n(X) \to C_{n-1}(X)$ is the **group $Z_n(X)$ of n-cycles**.
The boundary of a cycle is 0.

The image of $\partial_n : C_n(X) \to C_{n-1}(X)$ is the **group $B_{n-1}(X)$ of (n-1)-boundaries**.
The elements of this group $B_{n-1}(X)$ are exactly the elements of $C_{n-1}(X)$ that are the boundary of some chain in $C_n(X)$.

**Theorem 41.9**
$\partial_{n-1}\partial_n=0$ (or more briefly $\partial^2 =0$)

**Theorem 41.10**
$B_n(X)$ is a subgroup of $Z_n(X)$
Proof sketch: Since the boundary of a boundary is 0 and cycles are precisely the chains with boundary 0, every boundary is a cycle.

**Definition 41.11**
$H_n(X)=Z_n(X)/B_n(X)$ is the **n-dimensional homology group of $X$**.
