# John B. Fraleigh - A first course in abstract algebra



Note: The stuff here is older than the stuff I have for Tao - Analysis I. I wrote most of this before I started to write the statements to the exercises before solving them, so unfortunately the exercises only have my solutions, not the statements.



The organization is as follows: Each part has a folder, and each section has a separate Markdown file for just its exercises. For the content itself (definitions and such) there is a single Markdown file per part. This is not very neat and will change soon.
