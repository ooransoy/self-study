# Section 34
**Theorem 34.2 (First Isomorphism Theorem)**
Let $\phi:G\to G'$ be a homomorphism with kernel $K$. $\gamma_K:G\to G/K$ that for an element $g\in G$ gives which coset of $K$ it is in, is the canonical homomorphism. There is a _unique_ isomorphism $\mu:G/K\to\phi[G]$ s.t. $\phi(x)=\mu(\gamma_K(x))$. 
(Restatement of Theorem 14.11.)

**Lemma 34.3**
Let $N$ be a normal subgroup of a group $G$, and let $\gamma : G \to G/N$ be the canonical homomorphism (the map given by $\gamma(g)=gN$). The map $\phi$ from normal subgroups of $G$ containing $N$ to normal subgroups of $G/N$ given by $\phi(L) = \gamma[L]$ is bijective.
Remark: An intuitive way to think of this lemma is noticing the similarity to the complex function $f(z)=1/\bar{z}$. What the normal subgroups containing $N$ are to the points outside the unit circle, the normal subgroups of $G/N$ are to the points inside the unit circle.

Let $G$ be a group and $H,K$ subgroups of $G$. We define the **join** of $H$ and $K$ denoted by $H\vee K$ as the smallest subgroup of $G$ containing $HK$.
**Lemma 34.4**
For a group $G$, a subgroup $H$ of $G$, and a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, $H\vee N = HN = NH$. Also, if $H$ is normal then $HN$ is also normal.

**Theorem 34.5 (Second Isomorphism Theorem)**
For a group $G$, a subgroup $H$ of $G$, and a normal subgroup $N$ of $G$, $(HN)/N\cong H/(H\cap N)$.

**Theorem 34.7 (Third Isomorphism Theorem)** 
For normal subgroups $H\geq K$ of a group $G$, $G/H\cong (G/K)/(H/K)$.
