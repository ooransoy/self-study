**Axiom 3.8** (Universal specification) (Dangerous!)

Let $P(x)$ be a property pertaining to any property $x$. There exists a set $\{x:P(x)\}$ consisting of all objects satisfying $P$.



**Russell's paradox**

Let $P(x)\iff x\notin x$. Using universal specification, consider $\Omega:=\{x:P(x)\}$. If $\Omega\in\Omega$, $P(\Omega)$ does not hold so $\Omega\notin\Omega$. But if $\Omega\notin\Omega$, $P(\Omega)$ holds so $\Omega\in\Omega$. This is a contradiction, so Axiom 3.8 cannot hold.



**Axiom 3.9** (Regularity)

Let $A$ be a nonempty set. There is at least one element $x\in A$ which is either not a set, or is disjoint from $A$.

# Exercises

###### Exercise 3.2.1

> Show that If Axiom 3.8 were true, it would imply Axioms 3.2-3.6.



**3.2:** $\{x:\bot\}$

**3.3:** $\{x:x=a\}$, $\{x:x=a\vee x=b\}$

**3.4:** $\{x:x\in A\vee x\in B\}$

**3.5:** $\{x:x\in A\wedge P(x)\}$

**3.6:** $\{y:\exists x\in A,P(x,y)\}$

###### Exercise 3.2.2

> Let $A$ be a set. Show that $A\notin A$.



Using Axiom 3.3, we have $S=\{A\}$. By the axiom of regularity (3.9), it must be that there must be at least one element of $S$ that is either not a set or is disjoint from $A$. Since $S$ has only one element, $A$, this element must be either not a set or disjoint from $A$. Since it is a set, it must be disjoint from $A$, itself, i.e. $A\cap A=\varnothing$. Since $A\cap A=A$ by 3.1.28(c), $A=\varnothing$. By Axiom 3.2, $\varnothing$ ccontains no elements, so $A\notin A$.



###### Exercise 3.2.3

> Show that Axiom 3.8 is equivalent to the existence of the set of all objects $\Omega$.



$\implies$: Using universal specification, we can construct $\Omega=\{x:\top\}$. $\top$ is true for any object $x$, so every object $x$ is $\in\Omega$.

$\impliedby$: Using Axiom 3.5, we can construct $\{x\in\Omega:P(x)\}$. By definition, this set consists of all objects satisfying $P$, which is universal specification.
